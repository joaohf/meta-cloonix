meta-cloonix
============

This layer provides support for building images compatible with [Cloonix](https://clownix.net).

The bbappend files for some recipes (e.g. sysvinit-inittab) in this layer need to
have 'cloonix' in DISTRO_FEATURES to have effect. To enable them, add
in the configuration file (usually _conf/local.conf_) the following line:

    DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " cloonix"
